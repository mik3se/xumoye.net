                        <h1>The beginning of Xumoye, LLC</h1>
                        <p>In 2023, Michael had a vision. He saw how great the acoustic world could be. So he set off to fing a group of acoustic engineers with other key talents to run a business with him. Aaron Meyer, William Heng, and Oak Khant just happened to be the perfect people to be a part of Xumoye, LLC. Together, they all created Xumoye's first product, the xCabinet.</p>
                        <h1>How the xCabinet was created</h1>
                        <p>When Michael saw how underpowered phone speakers were, he quickly thought of buying a bluetooth speaker. After seeing how expensive those are, he decidede on creating his own product to amplify phone speakers wihtout using electronics. He assembled his team, who together, quickly created the model and named their invention the xCabinet.</p>
